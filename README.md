For the capstone course, Software Systems Development, at West Texas A&M University.

This web application is originally planned to ultimately be used by Los Barrios de Amarillo to assist with the scholarship application process. This is for the end-user side of the organization where it will focus on processing student scholarship submissions and searching for a wide or specific variety of scholarship documents.

**Notice: This project is still in early development, so essential features of the application are still in development and are subject to change.**
